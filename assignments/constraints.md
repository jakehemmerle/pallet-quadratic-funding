#### Time
This project will certainly face a time constraint. Our goal is to create a substrate pallet that implements quadratic funding, provides anti-collusion, and can prevent against Sybil attacks. While quadratic funding pallets already exist, none of them respect both of those two constraints. After consulting with our W3F Foundation contact, they assured us that this goal is possible but will likely take longer than one semester to complete in its entirety. This project is broken down into phases to help keep us on track, but all of these timeframes are estimations.

#### Scope
The scope of this project has been debated upon and aggreed by all members of the team. It is understood that if anyone needs clarification about the scope or specifics of the project that they can reach out to any other member for clarification. We all also understand that our scope may be over-reaching, and are prepared to dial back the deliverables if necessary. 

#### Technical Expertise
This project relies heavily on our ability to quickly learn a new programming language (Rust), as well as some other concepts and technologies. If we are not able to fully understand or grasp what this project entails by the time we start development, then it will most assuredly impact our goals and timeframes. This impact could appear as a solution that has been proven to be flawed or innefective.

#### Social
This project is focused on making Quadratic Funding with blockchain much more reliable and secure. If completed, this QF pallet would provide many communities the peace of mind to host crowd funding without worry of tampering by bad actors. This would also give peace of mind to organizations that contribute to the pool of funds used to match users' funds. In turn this could make QF more widespread and used in new, unique applications.
